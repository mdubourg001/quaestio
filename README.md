# Local quizz app

An application that allows the user to play a quizz locally in the browser:

- The quizz would be accessible via an URL like https://quizz.com?q=[b64-encoded-json-of-the-quizz]
- When accessing the URL, the user would see the title, optional thumbnail and description of the quizz, and a button to start the quizz
- After clicking the button, the user would see the questions one by one, with possible answers to choose from (depending on the question type)
- At the end of the quizz, the user would see their score and a button to copy the results as a formatted, shareable text
